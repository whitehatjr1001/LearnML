## Learn Machine Learning in 3 Months (PyTorch üî• Curriculum)

##### Overview

This is the Curriculum  for [Learn Machine Learning in 3 months (PyTorch Curriculum)](https://youtu.be/dS2HYPY7T-4) by Siraj Raval on Youtube. Beginners to Python will learn to build, train, deploy, scale & maintain modern Machine learning & Deep learning models. Each weekly assignment will teach you how to use a new concept or tool, like Docker, PyTorch, or Transformer Models. The Final Project will integrate everything you've learned into a Self Driving Car simulation. After completion, start an ML startup or find relevant work in the field. Together as a learning community, we're going to help each other succeed!
